## Appendix: Contribution Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Standard Monthly Employee
**Employee**: John Smith
**Monthly Salary**: GYD 150,000
**Calculation:**
- Employee contribution: GYD 150,000 × 5.6% = GYD 8,400
- Employer contribution: GYD 150,000 × 8.4% = GYD 12,600
- Total contribution: GYD 21,000

### Example 2: High Earner (Above Ceiling)
**Employee**: Jane Doe
**Monthly Salary**: GYD 400,000
**Calculation:**
- Insurable earnings: GYD 280,000 (ceiling applies)
- Employee contribution: GYD 280,000 × 5.6% = GYD 15,680
- Employer contribution: GYD 280,000 × 8.4% = GYD 23,520
- Total contribution: GYD 39,200
- Note: Contributions only on first GYD 280,000

### Example 3: Part-Month Employment
**Employee**: New hire starting on 15th
**Monthly salary**: GYD 120,000
**Days worked**: 15 days of 30-day month
**Calculation:**
- Pro-rated salary: GYD 120,000 × (15/30) = GYD 60,000
- Employee contribution: GYD 60,000 × 5.6% = GYD 3,360
- Employer contribution: GYD 60,000 × 8.4% = GYD 5,040
- Total contribution: GYD 8,400
