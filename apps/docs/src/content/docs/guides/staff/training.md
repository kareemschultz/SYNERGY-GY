## Document Management Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names:

- **Bad**: "document1.pdf"

### Categories

Always categorize documents correctly:
- `TAX` - Tax returns, assessments, receipts
- `FINANCIAL` - Bank statements, financial reports
- `IDENTIFICATION` - ID cards, passports, TIN
- `CERTIFICATE` - Registration certificates
- `AGREEMENT` - Contracts, service agreements

### Version Control

- Don't overwrite documents with same name
- Add version numbers or dates if needed
- Keep original client submissions separate from final versions

### Deadline Types

| **Client** | Document submission due |

### Never Miss Deadlines

- Check calendar daily
